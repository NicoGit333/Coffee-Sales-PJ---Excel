# Coffee Sales PJ - Excel

Hi this project consists of several orders of coffee types divided into (Arabica, Robusta, Excelsa and Liberica)

First I followed some steps to format the data and fill up the table that I'll use for the analysis and Dashboard

Then I got some pivot tables with that information in order to make an interactive Dashboard so the stakeholders can play with the dates, types, countries and top customers

Here you can see the Charts that I created

Here you can see the steps that I followed in order to make the final product: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HxK5DPPOWg-22kCBP8t72WtrH_Y_7JSn5ukRQn7JjGw/edit?usp=sharing
