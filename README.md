# Coffee Sales Interactive Dashboard - Excel

Hi this project has as its data source the sales of various types of coffee from 2019 to 2022.

In this case I use Excel to do all the cleaning, formatting and organization of the data, and then create graphs that can be viewed on an interactive Dashboard.

Here are the graphs that I created and the final Dashboard is attached in the repository.

Here you can see the steps that I followed in order to make the final product: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HxK5DPPOWg-22kCBP8t72WtrH_Y_7JSn5ukRQn7JjGw/edit?usp=sharing

The result of this project is an interactive Dashboard where the company can see the sales flow of each variant, the best clients, sales by country and the date range throughout the year.
