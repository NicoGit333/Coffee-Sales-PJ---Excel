# Coffee Sales PJ - Excel

Hi this project consists of several orders of coffee types divided into (Arabica, Robusta, Excelsa and Liberica)

First I followed some steps to format the data and fill up the table that I'll use for the analysis and Dashboard

Then I got some pivot tables with that information in order to make an interactive Dashboard so the stakeholders can play with the dates, types, countries and top customers
